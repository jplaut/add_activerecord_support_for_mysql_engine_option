= AddActiverecordSupportForMysqlEngineOption

This is a plugin for Rails 3 that modifies Active Record ruby schema dump to support adding an "engine" option to mysql migrations. This is necessary when creating tables that require a mysql engine to be specified, such as when creating spatial indexes.
